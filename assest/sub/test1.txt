The main reason as to why I am here is so I can get a degree and get ahead in life; not to mention that it is also expected of me to go to college. To elaborate more on that there are several subcategorizes that could better tell you about why I am here at Eastern Michigan University. The four things that have led me to where I am now are my hero, my family, my friends, and my own expectations.
What do you think about when you first hear this quote? "Not long ago, I asked my Freud class a question that, however hoary, never fails to solicit intriguing responses: Who are your heroes? Whom do you admire?"(On the uses of a liberal education. Edmunson, Mark p.83) I like this quote not only because I am fascinated by the questions, but also because everyone has heroes. I have many heroes some whom I don't know personally, such as author Nicholas Sparks, and other heroes that I do know- one of whom influenced me the most to go to college.
Many people might say their hero is their mom or one of their family members others may cite a colleague or celebrity. As for myself, the hero of my life is my former baby-sitter/ teacher Jessica Young. The story begins with me in forth grade and attending the after-school "latch key" program. Jessie was one of the facilitators of the program; she was working on a degree in elementary education and had just started her student teaching. She was the nicest person I had ever met and I worshiped her every move. In fact, we got along so well that my mom hired her to be my babysitter. Jessie was always there for me and always knew how to make me feel better. We had a lot in common, for instance we both liked country music and reading. She is not only my heroine because she made me want to follow in her footsteps, but she also taught me a lot of things that I know will help me in the future not only in regards to school, but in many other aspects of life as well.
